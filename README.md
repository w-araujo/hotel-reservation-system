  <ul>
       <li>
        Open the terminal or command prompt.
        </li>
        <li> 
        To clone the project via HTTPS, run this command:
        <p>
        <code>git clone https://github.com/w-araujo/hotel-reservation-system.git</code>
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        Make a copy of the <code>.env.example</code> file and rename this copy to <code>.env</code>, then fill in the remaining data. 
        </li>
        <li> 
       Now open the terminal at the root of the project and run the command <code>sudo docker compose up</code> to execute Docker Compose.
        </li>
        <li>
         Wait 30 seconds for the migrations to run automatically (if they don‚Äôt run, change the time <code>sleep</code> in the root project file <code>entrypoint-dev.sh</code> to a longer time)
        </li>
        <li>
          After completing all the steps above, run the seeds to populate the database with this command: <code>npm run prisma:seed</code> in the root project.
        </li>
        <li>
        If you don‚Äôt want to run the seeds, create a guest (Swagger) and change their role to "ADMIN" directly in the database.
        </li>
        <li>
        Use Swagger at this URL: <a href=http://localhost:3333/docs> Swagger</a>
